# JavaLab
This Repository holds my Java Programs for 4th Semester

The source code is in `src` directory, 
- `javalab` holds the all the java programs
- `kotlin` directory holds few of the program mainly DFS, BFS and Graph written in Kotlin.
- Also there is `io.kt` which is holds just a print function to replace `System.out.println` in my Java code.
